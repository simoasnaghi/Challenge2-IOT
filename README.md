# Challenge2-IOT
Repository containing my solution of the second challenge for the IOT course (AY 2021/2022).

Objective of the challenge: read data from a CSV by importing it into node-red, then extract only 100 values for field1, field2 and field5. The extraction is based on the person code. Last step export data from node-red to thingspeak by using mqtt communication protocol.
